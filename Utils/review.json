            "review": "CS:GO came out over 3,500 days ago, almost 10 years. Since 2014, CS:GO has never had less than 250,000 concurrent players. Many games in the last decade which are considered cornerstones of PC gaming, possibly even cornerstones of FPS games in general, never even achieved that many concurrent players at their absolute peak. In 2020, CS:GO hit its all time peak of over a million concurrent players playing all at the same time, an achievement that is likely only shared with truly Earth-shatteringly popular games like LoL and WoW. This is all to say that somehow, despite being almost a decade old, CS:GO remains one of the most popular titles on PC as a whole, beating out such rivals as Apex Legends, Valorant, Warzone, PUBG, Rainbow Six Siege, and pretty much every other FPS game you can let roll off the tongue, and likely any non-shooter title you can think of as well. I would venture to say that no game aside from Minecraft and PONG has had even remotely close to the staying power of CS:GO. \n\nAll that said, the game blows. Modern CS:GO looks dated, sounds dated, and plays like Valve's 1998 Half-Life. Source has completely knee-capped any opportunity for growth and innovation, and with a few minor meta changes and the introduction of new gamemodes and weapons, CS:GO is the same game now that it was 3,500 days ago. Some would argue that this is a sign of perfection, of effortless staying power, but I would argue that it is a sign of a lazy cash grab. Let's be honest, in comparison to modern competitors, CS:GO's movement is incredibly clunky. You can draw a direct lineage between crouch-jumping mid-doors on Dust II to completing puzzles in Black Mesa in Half Life. CS:GO is likely the only game about using firearms that does not allow you to ADS and more or less guarantees the user that the bullets coming from their firearm will not hit what they are looking at unless they have perfect movement, aim, and spray-pattern knowledge. Rất few weapons have been added in the last decade, and those that have been added are generally worse in every measurable way to those that they replace. Dust II remains the most popular map and has itself only seen a light graphical upgrade with only a small handful of map design changes. New maps are introduced, regularly complained about, and removed from the current map pool. If you are reading this in 2032, Dust II is likely still the most popular map and likely remains un-upgraded. \n\nSocially, the game is terrible. The vast majority of the user base is either incredibly toxic, racist, cheating, or a combination of all three. The way that matchmaking works, it is easy to come across smurf after smurf after smurf, losing game after game after game to players who's real skill is likely 10x higher than CS:GO placed them. I cannot begin to count the number of games in which I was subjected to player's profile pictures that were outright pornographic or I was called racial or homophobic slurs. \"Toxic\" does not even begin to describe how inhumane the CS:GO community can be at times. \n\nSo thus far, I have established that CS:GO is one of the most popular games on PC that has time and time again outlasted better competitors, I have dogpiled the game for looking, sounding, and playing like a game from 1998, and I have called all of the userbase toxic cheaters. If I believe all of these things, how can I possibly recommend the game? Easy - I only play CS:GO with friends. I play for fun and to collect skins. Many an hour has been spent, three or four beers deep, just chatting and joking with friends with CS:GO on in the background. Three, four, or even five-stacking pub matches is incredible fun. Playing the game in a public lobby where you and your friends work through elaborate, practiced routines of memes and jokes with poor, unsuspecting randoms is easily one of the funniest things you can do with a microphone and PC. Stupendous fun can be had when you find a player who has a sense of humor who will joke around with you as much as you with them. Every game is a win when you play with friends - you either lose the game so that your skill rating drops and you get to pub stomp the next lobby, or you win the game and your skill rating increases so that you can get pub stomped next game, thus setting you up for your own pub stomp. This circuitous motion is what keeps the game fun and fresh, you either get dumpstered on, dumpster a team, or the CS:GO matchmaking works for once and you have to fight for your life to get that 15:15. CS:GO sucks as a game, and you will never, ever see me playing it alone. But as a medium by which you can interact with your friends, CS:GO is unbeatable. Put a 30-rack in the fridge, get some T-Bell delivered, and get four friends who cannot hit the accept button with their aim and I guarantee you will make a life-long meme between the five of you.",

I played with the Early Access version back when it first launched and I already liked it. The game is now finished, has a proper story and you can play trough it without any issues. Not gonna lie, when I started playing the game I got addicted to it so much, that I only put it down when I got all the Achievements, and finished the story itself. Since then, I never really touched it. So I completed it on normal and decided to give it another try on Hard difficulty with my dudes. It's a little bit hard for them, because they just started playing it and never knew anything about the game, but they're at least enjoying it. I don't exactly know if I would complete this game alone once again, it's more fun and faster with other players.\n\n05/14/2022 - It's now on sale for 5,03€ (which is Historical Low price), so if you don't own it already, buy it it's well worth it for this price!\n\n",

I came into this really expecting some great, polished gameplay and left utterly confused how the game has above an 80% rating.\n\nCharacter progress is minimal, item gathering & base building feel uninspired, the monsters weren't that interesting, the world map felt very empty besides some preplaced events.  I had really high hopes given such great reviews but felt like it completely lacked in the \"survival\" category.  Maybe the entire focus is the story, but gameplay wise it just felt really cheaped and overlooked.\n\nMy personal favorite survival games are: 7 Days to Die, ARK, Don't Starve, Kenshi, Rimworld, Terraria, Valheim",

They’re all great, but the Prawn Suit in particular is absolutely badass and a mech done great.\n+ A lot of puzzle solving. Feels like a great achievement to beat the game.\n+ Ranges from fun tropical paradise, to mysterious and alien, to murky horror.\n+ The music can really amplify the mood of each area.\n+ Resource-gathering gameplay works well and never feels too grindy.\n+ Lots of tools at your disposal with different purposes.\n+ Lots you can build and do with your habitat home. If you like base-building, there's a lot for you to play around with here.\n+ Really good story despite a silent protagonist and lack of characters and dialogue.\n+ Rất immersive and gripping in general.\n\n[b]Negatives[/b]\n\n- In some parts my vehicle, in particular the Prawn Suit, could get stuck on parts of the terrain. Worth noting I only had to reload once from this (Sea Moth got stuck on part of the Aurora and couldn't be moved) and it was primarily with the Prawn Suit on land sections which are rare anyway.\n- I think a craftable tool to allow for mapping out your surroundings for reference would have helped greatly rather than relying on memory and beacons constantly for waypoints. This is very subjective however, I'm sure some others would say adding that in would have taken away from the exploration and experience of getting familiar with your environment. For me, I would have felt less of a draw to look up guides if I could see where I had been plotted out and start marking off where I had been and where I wanted to go next.\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\n\nSubnautica is a very unique experience and one I would highly recommend. I think the part that hit me most is when I realised I was actually nearing being able to escape the planet, and I realised how immersed I was in the world, having been stuck in the seas and gradually built up a base that had actually become somewhat homely and familiar and realising it was all going to be left behind. The fact the game made me feel that way shows how immersive it had all been. There’s nothing quite like Subnautica, it’s a fantastic deep sea exploration game. I will admit I used a guide to direct me around in parts which I would advise against for others, I just personally find the deep sea pretty spooky e.g. coming out over the edge of a cliff and there’s just murky nothingness stretching out around you in all directions and the potential for a looming shape off in the depths that you are powerless against. On the flip side, that should speak volumes for how immersive the game is and how it can be pretty scary in parts depending on how much the deep sea spooks you out.",

So much can be done, built and created, but its very unnecessary to \"win\" the game.   I would love to see more of this exact building scenario with a deeper story requiring other buildings (scanner building hardly if ever needed - helped with finding stalker teeth but not necessary), more open environment perhaps, and maybe a reason to build some of it.  Maybe a reason to get the upper tier power plants would be \"necessary\" for creating the ion powered battery or for operating a certain size structure.   Or maybe a stronger energy to supply the vehicle factory to build a sub vs just the regular energy for a Seamoth construction.   On a difficulty level of 0-10, this is a 4, imo.   I like the ease of some of the game, but it never really gets difficult.  \n\nTo developers:\n\nMaybe these things could happen with a 3rd release with a new scenario, obviously stranded, and having a puzzle or situation to solve is always the goal.    I did not need most of the buildings, or the prawn suit, and even swam through the game, even in lava zones,  without the extra strength suit (granted with health packs) and was able to solve or win the game.   I only built the sub to get the shield add-on needed for the escape spaceship.   The first time playing, I built everything and experienced most of the intended horrors, which was great!   I have hundreds of hours on this game and still love it in general.    It would be neat to have a surprise creature now and then, (not too often), but to throw a random in it somewhere not expected.   Perhaps it can be a different creature not usually seen or a random Leviathan that swims through an area (but not like clockwork) or attracted to power sources and a device is needed to short term (battery) mask the power-source or repel the creature.. Maybe like a slow moving Leviathan Shark that IF not not seen approaching and avoided, it just swallows you.  (dead - keeping the unknown fear up)..   Maybe a little damage done to a building that would need repairs, as it is there is little repair needed if you keep your level above zero.   I only had damage when a Reaper got stuck in the shallows and his thrashing damaged some of my base.   He had followed my sea-moth one time back to the shallows and another I believe I had brought an egg and dropped it below my base for lack of storage near the beginning.   I did not see a hatching but it was there when I got back one time and I could not get rid of it and was not sure how or why it was there (unless it was a glitch).\n\nAt times, the food and water are excessive.   I would like to see a daily need for food and water, rather than by the minute, for more realism.   I DO understand the need after a long swim needing replenishing but while driving around a Seamoth, I shouldn't be so thirsty and hungry, because the timer is running.   In RL, we can go 3 days without water without dying and 3 weeks without food in real life, so...  The necessity for a sleep cycle would be great too.   Even if its just sitting without a bed to rest with a bed sleep mode energizing more.   ( so a third meter on need for sleep or rest maybe?  just not excessive again, but more realistic timeline needed.)\n\nI still give the game a thumbs up and suggest everyone play it!    For a bigger challenge, do the hard mode where you have no warnings of loss of air and suddenly you are not close enough to get to the surface or back to a Seamoth, base, etc.  Game over, start all over, from the beginning.   \n\n",

This is truly a work of art and I am EXTREMELY glad to say I've finally, after nearly seven years, finished it.\n\nWhy did it take seven years? Simply put, you are not the biggest fish in the sea. There are things that will EAT you for a snack. And that is terrifying. That, and I'd get distracted by other things and loose interest, only to come back time after time. The story starts out simple, then gets complicated and very intriguing and just gets better from there.\n\nFrom resource gathering in the safe shallows, to much more dangerous areas, this *custom made map* (maybe random tech parts, but the map is static) is designed to be a challenge, but also give the player the utmost in freedom to explore, build and work the story their own way. Or, you can just ignore the story, build a base, and stay on 4546B for as long as you like.\n\nFolks, as I said, this game has taken me almost seven years to complete one playthrough from start to finish. It took over two hundred and sixty game-days to finally complete. Sure, there were some terrifying parts in there (Leviathans anyone?) but every minute of each of those days I enjoyed, one way or the other.\n\nFolks, I don't often give a thumbs UP for a game. Most of my reviews are meh or downright bad. This one, this one is a diamond in the rough. Get it. Enjoy it. Just remember. There are bigger things out there then you. And they're hungry.",

My son got this game for Christmas, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories",

The single player campaign has some really funny dialogue and pretty cool ship you can explore between missions. The mech A.I. companion and your robot mechanic buddy are the highlights of the campaign.\n\nThe mechs control more like walking tanks (Mechwarrior series, Steel Battalion, Shattered Steel) while you sit in the cockpit, as opposed to your average third-person super robot fantasy b.s. that you would find in Gundam and Armored core \n/start rant.exe (the creators of *those* series choose to let their mecha have feet, yet the mecha always seem to fly or hover everywhere... why? You have access to energy weapons and ballistics, but you end up choosing a lazer sword in a long range combat scenario?? again I must ask, WHY?!? Stupid gundam fantasy b.s. )/ end rant.\n\nTL; DR\nBig beefy stompy boi mechs that pew pew everything, and *you* are in drivers seat. Rất fun. Rất good. Much praise!",

My son got this game for Christmas, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories",

            "review": "When I first saw this game I thought it might be kind of similar to the game 'Rune Factory: Frontier' which I had played on the Wii.  I've eagerly awaited a port for PC but as of yet it currently can only be played on PC using an emulator.  Stardew Valley gave off some very similar vibes though so I thought maybe it might be close enough to sort of fill that same gap.\n\nThe game starts out simple enough, your grandfather left you a farm and you need to work to repair it and get it up and running again.  You chop logs, break rocks, till soil, plant seeds and harvest your crops.  There's a  lot of room to play around with your farm and where you want to place things.  There's also a foraging aspect which helps encourage exploration of your surroundings too.  The game is more than just a farming sim though, it also has RPG elements and you can battle monsters in the mines that in turn drop loot you can use or sell.  In addition to that it has some adventure game aspects such quests and some fairly light puzzles.  You can date and marry certain people in the town and even have two kids.  Later in the game you can even forge your own weapons and equipment and add specific power-ups to them.\n\nI grew up on pixel graphics so I found the graphics to be somewhat nostalgic feeling.  The animations are fairly simple and the character sprites very 2D but the characters themselves, not so much.  Each character has a bit of a backstory and unique character traits you get to know as you build friendship points.  At certain levels of friendship you're given the treat of special little cut scenes.  You get to make choices on how you respond to the cut-scenes too.  Sometimes it can help your relationship or hurt it.  This adds quite a bit of story elements to the game.\n\nPart of the beauty of this game is that you can play it in so many ways.  If you just want to have a calm farming experience, growing crops, playing around with aesthetics or optimal functionality in your builds, then you can play it that way.  The music in the game somehow manages a great balance of calming and upbeat.  If you want a little more excitement you can delve deep in the different mines and battle a variety of monsters and collecting and crafting better gear.  If you like adventure then you'll probably want to work on completing quests and solving the puzzles.  If you're more into stories you'll probably enjoy making friends with everyone and exploring their personalities.  Really, there's a little something for everyone and enough content that if you get bored there's something else to try.\n\nIn the early game it really feels like completing the community tasks mounts to a climax.  It's easy little goals to attain and strive for but once you finish the community center that's really just the beginning of the game.  You can unlock other mines, a desert, and an Island.  The game is much more expansive than you will first anticipate and it's possible that the developer may release future expansions to bring even more content and explorable areas.  The game does have a sort of \"ending\" in which you'll see a special cut scene but you can keep playing on so the game doesn't ever truly end.  You can also create a new character to play again from the beginning.  There are different farm types that present different challenges and benefits which make for a little replay-ability.\n\nIn addition to different maps you can also play this game in co-op mode with friends.  I don't personally like multi-player experiences, I prefer solo adventures, but I do like that if you chose to play this way each character can have their own house and while you can work together, you can also go off and do your own thing.  You aren't limited to the host's farm or experiences and guests can upgrade their cabin, get married, and essentially experience everything the games has to offer.\n\nThere are really only two things I disliked about this game.  First, there's the save function, you can only save by going to sleep (or ending the day by falling asleep outside your home/bed or \"dying\" in the mines {you can't actually die you just get beat to within inches of your life apparently}).  Sleeping ends the day and your game progress is saved.  However, I often find that I have to leave my game in the middle of a day when I don't have time or the ability to finish my day or even run to my bed so I can save.  Instead, I had to open the menu, which pauses the game, and then either just leave it running in the foreground or if I had to do something on my computer, let it run in the background till I could get back to the game.  So, for example, at the time of writing this review, Steam has 1,062.9 hours logged playing this game.  However, between my two save files I only have about 509 hours logged in-game.  So, it spent about half the time sitting open in the background on my computer simply because I could hit a save button and continue later.\n\nThe second thing I didn't like was the fishing mini-game.  I've played plenty of games that have fishing mini-games in them and they are all similar but all have their own unique flair... this one is the worst fishing mini-game I've ever played.  Maybe other people found it easy but I couldn't get how to catch fish.  There's something to do with patterns and clicking at the right times but I completely failed at it every time.  The only thing that made fishing redeemable was actually a mod that let me skip the mini-game portion.  While I don't necessarily advocate mods, I found the game partially unplayable because of this mini-game and it was really ruining my personal experience with playing the game.  The mod made the game playable and fun again.\n\nMods are actually one of the things that for some players could be a real plus side to the game.  Stardew Valley has a fairly large modding community with mods for everything from changing the NPC's dialogue avatar to skipping fishing mini-games to adding elevators to creating new expanded areas to explore.  If you find yourself too frustrated with an aspect of the game, there's probably a mod for it.  If you love mods for games you'll love this game.\n\nThe last thing I'd like to touch on is the game's achievements.  There's 40 of them which is a fair amount and most will unlock naturally over time with normal gameplay, but there are several collection based achievements that you have to work for.  Many of those require a lot of hours of game play.  For example, if you want to catch all the fish you won't be able to do it unless you fish in every season, some require reaching maximum friendships which can take a lot of time to build, and of course others require you to get a huge sum of money.  Collectible items are gained through RNG drops so even if you do everything right you could be doing it a long time to get those drops you need.  For completionists, like me, that can be very frustrating and it's a big part of why I had to put in about 500 hours to get all the achievements.  It could be a lot less or even more depending on your luck with the RNG.\n\nOverall, this game is a gem, I don't usually recommend games at full retail price, but I'd say this one is actually worth it.",

            "review": "Let me start by saying I absolutely LOVE this game. Iv'e currently got just over 410 hours played. That's just over 17 days back to back nonstop. It's like battlefield but slightly more intense. One bullet to kill for most rifles under 200 meters. But I cannot justify at this moment, suggesting someone to buy it. This is a community based game, there is no story, no real progression other than getting a few different load outs with certain roles. As a min/maxer, progression is usually needed but not here. The games are interactive, heart pounding, and absolutely terrifying in some cases. If you are sitting there thinking this sounds fun so far, it is, INCREDIBLY so. But as a new player, you have a very difficult challenge ahead of you. There is no tutorial as of April 16th, 2022, so anything you want to learn about the game or how to play, you need to study. That means talk to other players, only during an active match tho, or watch videos and guides on youtube. This leads to long time players resenting newer players. As a new player, you will only bring your teams effectiveness down (solely because you have not been taught the game). I don't blame the players or the community, I solely blame the devs for this. Hell Let Loose matches DEPEND on ALL players of a team, and I love this about this game. It's not just about killing, but squads working together to form a whole unit/team. But the game ITSELF does not tell you this, or at least in an effective way. And that is why I blame the developers and cannot recommend, at this time, that you purchase this game. I want this game to become more popular and to become a model for future war/military games. And I want more players and more servers, but until the issue of teaching new players how to play this game is addressed, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. You will get yelled at, kicked out of games, and this can lead to a resentment for this game and the players. Just keep this game on your wishlist until you see the issues here being addressed.\n\nEdit: Some things are being taken out of context, My main issue with this game is the lack of in-game information about the game and the importance of certain things. Examples being garrisons, squad roles and their uses, positioning, how redzones work, things of the sort. There is very basic information explaining what they are BUT NOT WHY they are useful. As a player, and not a developer, I have no control over installing an in depth tutorial. I cannot change anything about the workings of the game and neither can you. Only a developer can add/remove things from the game itself. A tutorial would fall under this category. That is why I have a problem with the developers. As far as community goes, I could lie to people and say every person in the community is a great person and only wants to help, while that rings true for MOST, it does not take away from the fact that you WILL experience negative people or \"rude\" people. IF that is someones FIRST impression, it's not a good one and can have a negative effect on the new player, tainting their first experience WHILE not understanding the game either. This is my point towards the \"community\" aspect in regards to a new players perspective of the game. A good first impression is a good one, a bad one is bad. Not understanding the game AND having a bad first impression can push people away from the game.\n\n\nTL;DR: Game needs a tutorial for new players. Too steep a learning curve that can ruin matches for long term and new players when an influx of first time players (specifically lacking the knowledge of how the game works)  joins the game. This isn't call of duty and the game does not specify why it is not.\n\nThank you to everyone interacting and commenting on this, I understand I may not be perfectly clear on my points so I appreciate you keeping me in check and calling me out. Just don't forget, the only reason I don't recommend this game is lack of tutorial. This is by far my favorite and most played game, I'm just trying to make it easier for when brand new, first time players join the game. A tutorial can provide the necessary information to help ease new players in.",

            "review": "I don't normally like PvP games and I am total rubbish at them.\n\nTypically I wouldn't recommend this sort of game, however this game drips atmosphere.  The Saving Private Ryan comparisons are obvious because it feels like you are experiencing a movie when you play.   Just watch a few videos on Youtube of the gameplay and you will see what I mean.\n\nExpect to die a lot in this game.    Most times I die without ever seeing the enemy and I assume they are prone in the grass/bushes.   It can get frustrating when you are prone in a trench with sandbags on either side of you and the enemy still gets a headshot on you.   As long as you go into this game with a healthy attitude about possibly being the worst player on your team you will do fine.\n\nI am specially bad at single fire weapons because if you miss that first shot on the enemy you will be the one dying.   I tend to stick to classes that allow me the ability to spray bullets since my accuracy is horrible.\n\nCheaters are thing with this game of course.   Last night I witnessed an enemy we couldn't kill even with automatic, single fire, bazookas, and MG all firing on him from about 100m away.  He was the first person I could confirm was cheating.     The worst part of PvP games like this is the paranoia that sets in when you are killed from unseen enemies.  This happens a lot with this game.   It will drive you nuts if you think everyone is cheating.\n\n\nBasic Observations:\n\nSome classes unlock automatic weapons once you reach the 3rd level ranking (for instance Support).    I recommend you look through the classes and decide upon a class you want to level up.\n\nThe medic class doesn't have much ammo and is completely useless for offensive.   Reviving your downed team mates is a good way to not feel completely useless though.   Everyone loves a medic that goes prone and crawls through gunfire to revive a downed player.    Many people do not recommend to bother with the 3rd level unlocks for a medic (the ability to spawn medic supplies is really not needed and not worth losing a primary weapon for).",

But at some point you cross over the line into tedious and frustrating. There are vast distances in this game to cover between spawn and ground fighting meaning that you are spending more time walking than actually fighting. Something that I am sure is very true to actual war but creates boredom in a game. Not to mention that the respawn times are very long (and that's conservative) after you have just been instantly killed just trying to walk to the fight. All in all I have really tried to like this game but due the aforementioned factors this game simply is not fun.",

            "review": "If you loved the original Subnautica, you'll at least like this game. I found that, throughout my entire play through, the whole experience didn't feel nearly as mysterious and terrifying as the first game. In BZ, they replaced the huge, open map with a small, almost linear one. While some may like that, I didn't personally; I loved the huge areas of purely dark water with no visible bottom (obviously excluding the void) and the excitement of exploring these uncharted waters. In BZ, however, since there was an entire team of scientists, engineers, etc. in the area to begin with, it feels like the entire map's already been explored, which discouraged me from exploring it. The biomes don't feel nearly as unique as they did in Subnautica; they almost blend together. \n\nThe story is okay. It's nothing life changing. Now, the original's wasn't either, but it was at least different. There are two main story lines in BZ: the one regarding the death of Robin's sister and the one about helping AL-AN. The latter has an interesting ending, and goes into the Architects in greater detail, but the one with Sam is just boring. I didn't care at all about the Sam story line; I had no incentive to find out what happened to her. It was, frankly, boring.\n\nOverall, if you loved the original  you should definitely try BZ; while it's not as good, it gives you more of the Subnautica experience, but in a different fashion. While the original is a 10/10, BZ is probably a 7/10 for me.",

            "review": "[h1]🤢😞🙁😐🙂>😊<😍[/h1]\n🐳 If there was only one thing I could tell you about Below Zero before you buy it, I would simply point at the Discussions in the Community Hub; the first thing you'll see there is an enormous thread called [i]'You ruined the game',[/i] which you shouldn't open due to the obvious spoilers galore that's inside. It's got way over a [b]thousand[/b] comments now, and people keep bickering there every single day:\n\n[i]'Below Zero sucks! I hate it, it makes my blood boil!'[/i]\n[i]'No, ya dimbo, it's great! I loved every second of it!'[/i]\n...ad infinitum.\n\nDespite the fact that a full year has elapsed since the game's release, neither the defence nor the prosecution have been able to make their closing arguments, 'rest their cases' and just go home. The smouldering embers of this dumpster fire just refuse to die, and I believe you can already draw some important conclusions based on that fact alone. People feel strongly about this game and the franchise in general.\n\nI am one of those who loved Below Zero despite its shortcomings, but I will make an effort to remain impartial and unbiased in this review and explain both sides of the story. If you don't like going in blind with your entertainment purchases, stay awhile and I promise you'll come out the other side much better equipped to make a well-informed decision.\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2796283190\n🐋 The most resounding complaint, the overarching theme of all disparaging comments is the fact that the main heroine... [i]talks.[/i] The mute, expressionless dummy we controlled in the original installment is now replaced by Robin – a female researcher who is practically never at a loss for words. Some players attach significant importance to the atmosphere of utter loneliness and helplessness that was present in the previous game; for them, this atmosphere [i]is[/i] Subnautica. If you share this point of view, you're in for a nasty surprise – not only does Robin talk, but she's also not the only human being around. \n\nTo be honest, I didn't mind the vocal protagonist and additional characters one bit – [i]on the contrary,[/i] I enjoyed the unusual flavour it gave to already familiar game mechanics. It felt fresh and I'm glad the devs decided against doing more of the same and in favour of being bold and creative. The lonely and helpless feel of the first game was born from the [b]absence[/b] of things – absence of ideas, absence of characters, absence of interactions; the product of natural limitations of a small studio, and barely the pinnacle of game design. \n\n🐡 The voiced heroine is not the only groundbreaking change, however. Anyone who's played the first part remembers that there were some land sections – a couple of small islands, if you don't count the Aurora. In Below Zero, land sections make a return, but now they're beefed up on steroids and occupy nearly 50% of the entire map – but we're still playing Sub[u]nautica,[/u] right?.. \n\nWhen on land, your body temperature drops at an alarming rate; thankfully, there is a variety of ways to keep it at optimal levels – the one you'll be using most often is jumping back into the freezing arctic water. \n\nSure. Makes sense🤔\n\n🐟 When not exploring snow-covered plains and mountain tops, you'll find that most ocean biomes are pretty crammed, with the majority of them being caves, ravines and twisting narrow passages of different kinds. I find that to be a pretty clever design choice; in the previous game, if you badly needed oxygen and safety, you could just... [i]go up.[/i] Here, directly up oftentimes leads nowhere, and the feeling of claustrophobia suddenly locks you in its wet, sickening embrace – especially if you have 10 seconds of oxygen left. To compensate for that, there are now oxygen plants sprinkled here and there throughout the dark depths, and you'll be frantically looking for them, praying to see that welcoming green glow around the next bend. This adds a whole other layer of emotional intensity that the original simply didn't have. \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2800073898\n🐠 Many players complain that this iteration of the series is guilty of 'handholding' you and does so in an annoying, obtrusive way; how I wish that was true! From the very beginning, you can go pretty much anywhere, but the story in Below Zero is presented in such a way that there is only one 'correct' path you may take that will allow all the little bits and pieces of the main plot you gather along the way to make sense. Unfortunately, I wasn't so lucky and didn't do things the 'intended' way; very often me and my partner were scratching our heads, completely stumped as to what the heck we were supposed to do next, and we had no such issues with the first game. The writing is sometimes sloppy and at odds with the story of the original. All that is one of the [b]two[/b] reasons I couldn't give Below Zero the 😍 rating.\n\n🐬 The second one is the omnipresence of bugs and glitches, especially if you're brave (or stupid) enough to build your base on land. Things will constantly break for no reason at all; floating staircases, disappearing vehicles, the whole shebang. This is nothing new, as the first Subnautica also had similar problems, but this time the issues are pretty glaring and I have no idea how the devs missed them. \n\n🐚 On a more positive note, if there is truly something to pat Unknown Worlds Entertainment on the back about, that will be all the clever ideas they introduced in Below Zero; I couldn't help but say [i]'Oh, so now we have THIS!'[/i] nearly every time I sat down to play the game. One example of that would be the jukebox; you can now listen to music in your base and in your main vehicle as you explore the neverending cave systems, and every single song absolutely [i]slaps.[/i] They tried to include as many genres as possible; there are [b][url=https://youtu.be/E87WYWs4xZU?t=62]beautiful, unexpectedly emotional songs[/url][/b] that make exploration feel much more immersive than it was in the first game, and there is also... okay, sit down if you're standing – there is [i]Subnautica rap.[/i] This stuff starts at unbearable levels of cheese and comes full circle to being simply [b][url=https://youtu.be/RBdm83TdkeM?t=39]genius[/url][/b]. Never been a fan of rap music, but I appreciate the level of creativity that went into writing these lyrics. Overall, the presence of the jukebox spells death to the rather primitive (in my opinion) 'lonely and helpless' atmosphere and proclaims the beginning of a new, multi-layered kind of fun you've never felt in Subnautica before. \n\nOh, almost forgot – you can add your own songs, and it's really simple. \nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2802309020\n🐙 All right – time to wrap this one up. For me, Below Zero was able to reignite the spark, returning the wonderful feeling of being lost in an unfamiliar world. I played the original for well over 100 hours, completed it several times with and without mods, and the excitement naturally dwindled; I knew what to expect, what to do, and where to go. Below Zero combined relative familiarity with core gameplay mechanics and a completely different environment; even though it made some mistakes along the way, it accomplished the main goal –  allowing me to go on a brand new adventure once again, and for that I'm thankful.\n\n🦈 P.S. Some particularly nasty individuals can't stop going on about this game being 'woke' because it's got a couple of gay characters and a black female as a protagonist; if you get your panties in a bunch because you see 'propaganda' in a game where someone's sexual orientation is casually mentioned [i]once,[/i] then get on yer little soapbox and speak of your petty frustrations to the world – whatever, everyone is entitled to have an opinion. Just don't be surprised when we laugh at you.",

            "review": "Below Zero takes everything that was captivating and amazing about Subnautica and blatantly disregards it in an attempt to break new ground with a new story.  \n\nEvery individual component of the game is executed worse than the previous iteration.\n\nThe story is the least disappointing part, except for the part where you've already figured out everything about halfway through. There are no surprises, no twists, no turns. Character vignettes are surprisingly well done, and they did a good job making the unseen cast have their presence felt. The decision to voice the protagonist and give them their own spoken narrative... obliterates the storytelling whenever she speaks up. She's not very relatable, and her dialogue is mediocre most of the time. The VA performance is great, from her and the rest of the cast. But it never stops being jarring every time she speaks, and really breaks the feeling of isolation and tension. I want to feel like I'm uncovering something spooky and mysterious, and it's impossible to do that if every time I find something notable, the main character pipes up to give commentary that often doesn't fit the mood of the player at the moment.  \n\nLocations are a nightmare. The world map is broken up in such a way that you find yourself doing mostly \"dead-end\" journeys. You venture out to an area, and have to go further and further into it until you find what you were looking for, and then retrace your steps methodically to leave. There are few interconnections, most locations only have one way in or out, with tons of dead space between their entrances and where you need to go. You will constantly be backtracking your way out of the same places you've been. Cave networks are more convoluted and devoid of landmarks that make navigation palatable. You can expect to run in circles wondering if you've actually explored the breadth of an area, because the one branch looks identical to the next.  \n\nCreatures are mostly underwhelming. Most of the \"enemies\" can be safely disregarded, and apart from a few areas, don't guard or patrol anywhere remarkable. The predator creatures are often copy-pasted to ridiculous extents in otherwise empty waters, but can still be avoided simply by going around them. \n\nLand exploration is like pulling teeth. Journeying through blinding snow is exhausting, as every location looks and feels the same. Land areas are open and repetitive, with few interesting landmarks or terrain to make them unique. You unlock a hoverbike to help you navigate the terrain, but then they make much of the terrain in those areas poorly navigable on the bike. At no point do you have an opportunity to open up the throttle and speed across the glaciers, really making use of the mobility. \n\nVehicles are worse than before. Cooler concepts, but after 16 hours I hadn't found enough researched parts to really build out any of the offerings. An upgrade here, an upgrade there. Never really felt like I got to use them beyond just taxi service. The Prawn is completely unused in the game apart from those players who may want to build megabases for fun.  \n\nOverall, if you've played the first one, you can safely leave this aside.",

Replaces the Seamoth and Cyclops, and is takes on all of the very worst aspects of each. It is less durable than the Seamoth and consumes power worse than the cyclops. It is less maneuvarable than the cyclops and is weirdly shaped which makes it hard to fit into spots that look fittable, but aren't. I lost 2 Sea Trucks just bumping into random objects, whereas the Sea Moth, despite it being flimsy, held up better than it. Also the Sea truck has almost zero storage space, with lockers that are 3x5 4x5 and 5x6. Standard built lockers are like 6x8. It isn't intuitive on separating from the attached modules and wasn't intuitive in attaching to them.  \n-> Less direction. You don't get many nav points in this one, so you'll be told something important is nearby, but not in what direction or if it is above or below you. I had to use guides to find story-specific locations, as I couldn't find them otherwise. \n-> Fewer resources. I was constantly starved for lead and gold, and just could not find enough of it. In Subnautica, you'd have groups of resources types ie copper, titanium, and lead. Now its copper or titanium, lead or titanium, silver or titanium, etc... It is also harder to acquire salt and quartz too for some reason. \n-> Base building underwater felt more restrictive, as the support poles wouldn't attach a lot of the time, making it impossible to place modules otherwise. \n-> The story was lacklustre and the characters weren't interesting.\n\nI ended up quitting the game and giving up. I was trying to find Margerites greenhouse, hit an ice berg, and lost my sea truck again, for a third time, and as I was 1800 meters from my lifepod, I just didn't have the desire to swim back, hunt for lead and gold again, to rebuild the darn sea truck. And like Subnautica, if it is destroyed, all its modules are gone as well. \n\nI got it for 50% off, so I feel a bit better about that, but having played and enjoyed a lot of Subnautica, I was hoping for more of that here and I was severely disappointed. And the modding community isn't as great so there aren't even mods out there to fix the issues I had. Shame. Guess, I'll have to launch Subnautica again to get my underwater fix.",

Furthermore, it's very short and there is no satisfying ending. To make matters worse, the game gives you sometimes little to no guidance on where to progress further, it just tries to inflate the otherwise short playtime by forcing you to wander around - on one occasion I had to look up a location online, otherwise I would have literally got stuck at that point.\n\nThe map: is too small and uninteresting, and the different biomes are not distinctive enough which makes navigating unnecessarily difficult. This is especially true for the biomes above water, where everything just looks the same. The map size does not even necessitate building a base for the sake of it being more central, which in Subnautica was a lengthy and worthwhile undertaking. Such a shame that they put so much effort into the base assets (much more and nicer than in the original) that you are not required to use.\n\nThe animals: do not even come close to the original game. Nothing beats Reaper Leviathans. The scary animals in this game are just not scary, though the penguins are nice.\n\nThe tech: feels rehashed and repetitive. Compared with the great vehicles of Subnautica, these feel very badly designed for exploration and are not good at what they do. I miss the Cyclops. The Seatruck is just an absolute oaf, difficult to pilot in tight spaces and you can barely see out of the cockpit, which makes navigating super difficult.",

I had tons of fun for the first hour and a half, running around collecting materials, finding out some of the story, and even constructing the seatruck. But then I encountered an issue that completely ruined this experience for me. I went to the Delta Base beacon and everything was completely unloaded and I phased right through the ground. I thought, ok thats annoying but I can just reload the game and hopefully it will be there. I then attempted to save the game and then quit, but I was stuck on the saving screen for more than 20 minutes. I finally had to force quit the game to get out of the save bug and I logged back in to see that all of my progress is gone. This is supposed to be a complete game and has been out for over a year now. These kinds of game breaking issues should not still be in the game. Having this happen to me completely ruined the experience for me and I immediately uninstalled the game. Maybe I will pick it up again in a couple months and play it, but how am I supposed to know this won't happen again?",

It has a lot of good stuff and I can't fault anyone for liking it, but for me it just didn't live up to what it could have been.\n\nThe biggest issue is how cramped and, for lack of a better word, shallow the map felt overall. The addition of the above-ground snow stuff was just terrible and a slog and wasted a lot of development time for a sub-par experience, which could have been spent really giving things breadth. Some of the new biomes were absolutely great, but as a whole, and I don't exactly know how it managed to do this, felt cramped. How an 'underwater' game feels cramped is almost mind boggling in how misjudged it was.\n\nA worse vehicle on top of the mandatory, unfun above ground annoying to navigate snow-worm area - which if you sped fast and jumped with the bike, the snow worm would burst out of the middle of the air to be underneath you, complete with snow debris - took the wind out of the game in a very unpleasant way.\n\nThe original worked because of the thalassophobia effect, excellent level and maybe the best sound design in any media ever, much less a video game, that worked in concert with said effect. When there is almost no deep, open water where anything might be lurking, when you can see all the edges in most of the biome areas, you almost always have a visual anchor.. eh. Falls flat.\n\nAs someone with thalassophobia, the first game was staggering in immersiveness and almost impossible to play it was so tense. BZ feels very safe and light. The tension and atmosphere and the lurking danger of the dark unknown of Subnautica was a heavy weight that kept you submerged.",

I wish the devs had spent less time world building and more time building environment size, leviathan size, and sea truck size.

Not to mention the pure realism of the world, graphics and game mechanics, followed by amazing soul touching music that brought me to tears.\n\nBy the end I was so attached to the main character I just felt grief and gratitude for living that life, that inevitably had to end. It was like losing a good friend and it kept me sad for days after I finished the game.\n\nI doubt I can appreciate any other open world game the same anymore. I play games since 1999 and this is by far the best one I've experienced.\n\nIt is truly , without a doubt, a masterpiece.",

For example, the metal detector used to work, and now it doesn't.  Also, they need to make it MUCH easier to contact customer support.  I don't want to be lost in an endless loop of web pages with suggested solutions that don't address the problem.  If they'd fix the problems, the game would be fine.",

A great pattern for other fps games...\nControl your robot, shooting at everything like a big villain... \n[/i]\n\n-[b]Customizations : 7/10[/b]\n[i]The customization part is not too bad, you can change your character,titans,weapons skin but it is not like Battlefield or CoD... you can customize your weapon loadout.\nBut many things are lacking and this is a big weakness!\nSince I could not play the multiplayer part, I do not have enough information about it.\n[/i]\n\n-[b]Story: (8/10)x1.5[/b]\n[i]Jack Cooper is the Pilot protagonist and the playable character, beginning his military career as a Rifleman in the Frontier Militia.\nHe is the pilot of his best friend named BT-7274, indeed he is a robot but his emotions are like a human. you will have a great adventure with BT-7274.\nIn fact, I can not communicate with robots,that is, I can not accept robots as humans.\nBut at least it has a deeper story than other fps games like DOOM or Serious Sam![/i]\n\n-[b]Gameplay: 11/10[/b]\n[i]Excellent level of gameplay, everything is great, control your robot and shoot at anything you see, \nYou will become a speed runner,everything is well coordinated,I have never seen an example like this game.\n\"Unparalleled\" gameplay.\n[/i]\n\n-[b]Artificial Intelligence: 8/10[/b]\n[i]I didn't see any weakness in my experience, robots don't act as stupid as movies ...\nIt's better than other fps games so I have no reason to give a low score!\nBut for me as a hardcore player, it is not perfect...\n[/i]\n\n-[b]Audio: 9/10[/b]\n[i]Great voice acting, gunfire sounds are mehh I dunno how to explain!\nUnfortunately robots talk like idiots just like in the movies...[/i]\n\n-[b]PC Requirements: 10/10[/b]\n[i]The game runs smoothly on my system, well optimized.\nThe game uses source engine from valve so don't worry about system requirements!\nBut try to upgrade your system because the more frame rates, the more fun you will have!\n[/i]\n\n-[b]Grind: 7/10[/b]\n[i]Nothing special,you will finish the game in a week then you going to play multiplayer or share your screenshots...\nThis is a game with a specific storyline, not a game with multiple endings...[/i]\n\n-[b]Game Time: 8/10[/b]\n[i]Fairly short single player campaign but it has great quality content.\n\n-[b]Price: 10/10[/b]\n[i]You will not regret it, so add it to your cart right now!\nBut buy it for single player because multiplayer is dead/servers are down.[/i]\n\n-[b]Bugs: 10/10[/b]\n[i]Played it about 13 hours, didn't see any bugs![/i]\n\n-[b]Soundtracks: 9/10[/b]\n[i]Halo and Star Wars had children! I mean it feels epic.\nEar-catching soundtracks.\nBut it can not be in your daily playlist![/i]\n\n-[b]Multiplayer Mode: -/-[/b]\n[i]One of the best multiplayer games of all time, but the servers are down!\nGamers miss this game so much...\nPoor support by Respawn and EA... they threw it in the corner.[/i]\n\n[h1]Overview[/h1]\n[i]I definitely recommend buying this game.\nTotal Score: 9.1★\nThank you for reading my review!:)[/i]",

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).\n2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.\n3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.\n4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.\n5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.\n6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",

            "review": "Titanfall 2 is just fantastic.  A campaign that is more than just an enjoyable adventure, it features constantly evolving mechanics always surprising you with new twists and exciting things to do.  It brings a freshness I haven't seen since Portal 2, while keeping the length at \"just about right\".\n\nThere's genuine effort put into the plot and level design of what could have otherwise been a barebones story thrown in as a tutorial for the multiplayer mode.  Instead, what little I heard of it made me check the game when I had no interest whatsoever in trying its multiplayer aspects.  And I'm glad I got on this ride because it was such a fun romp!\n\nWhile you can see most of the story outcomes (including the ending) come from a mile away, the moment to moment parts are crafted so well that it won't matter how predictable things are.  Your character goes from low rank infantry trooper to an experienced mech pilot through the many gauntlets the story throw at you, and they are all glorious, memorable set pieces that vary the gameplay just enough, while introducing all sorts of charismatic villains to face off in such clashes.\n\nAnd through all of that, the bond between the main character and the Titan's self-learning AI (nicknamed BT) grows slowly but noticeably and -- silly as it may seem -- that too becomes a highlight.  From initially addressing the MC as a disposable \"Pilot\", to \"Cooper\", and eventually to first name basis \"Jack\", it's a scene with meaning and heart when BT suddenly turns to the MC and says \"trust me\" like an actual battle comrade would instead of just silently proceeding with the mission.\n\nOn to the gameplay, this too is a standout experience that differentiates Titanfall 2 from other shooters.  With a fluidity and precision that are so seamless, you end up pulling whatever creative moves you can think of.  Wall walking, double jumping, the stealth mode strafing, the absurd selection of weapons available to loot from the different militias (each weapon with its own distinctive feel), it all comes together to form a frantic parkour-infused action package that somehow manages to stay elegant at all times.  And that's you playing as a soldier on the ground!  The moment you embark on your humongous mech, the world changes, the tiny people in the ground trying to shoot are insignificant and only the brutal clashes against other Titans matter.  It's satisfying how those two completely different realities coexist so well together.\n\nAll in all, a shame that the likelihood of a sequel of this quality is unlikely to ever appear.",

I don't recommend this game anymore it's not even worth the $4 USD they are asking for it, at this point they are snatching at any money they can make, but don't have hope for a third one with their shift towards battle royal, I will miss BT, and I will miss my minigun titan hot dropping and wiping the other team out.",

It is very disheartening to see one of my favorite childhood games and franchises loose to a outside source. I love this game the series to death. If you are looking to purchase to play multiplayer good luck. The server will randomly crash but on other days they work. Its very shaky right now and sadly I think that is the best this game can do to recover. I dont have many hours on my steam profile. But I was easily gen 15 on my Xbox and played this game religiously when it came out (Thats about 300-500 hours for those who dont know). I love this game to death and I hope to see a sequel! Keep it up! Apex is a great game as well!",

            "review": "I would 100% recommend this game. After 600 hours I still can't seem to put the game down for long before getting the itch to pick it back up. Even in the current state the Multiplayer is in. I will clarify on that towards the end.\n\nThe campaign, while short, is well worth the experience. It comes in around 5-6 hours depending on how well you pick up the mechanics. The level design does an outstanding job of teaching you the game while not getting stale. They introduce a new mechanic, let you play with it, then move on to the next one. This provides a real sense of progression. The story itself is well written in such a way that you feel a connection between BT and Cooper that I have rarely experienced in most other games. There are ups and downs. Laughs and somber moments. Sure some of the characters and set pieces can be cheesy or over the top, but that's gaming and it works for TF|2. Overall my only gripe is that at the end I felt  myself wanting more of the campaign. They took the foundation from TF|1 and really hit it out of the park.\n\nNow for the Multiplayer. I played before, during, and after the hacks/DDOSing that brought the game and community to its collective knees. Before the hacks the game was so much fun. The skill floor and ceiling are high BUT, the community for the most part is super welcoming and willing to help new pilots learn the ropes. I would know as that's how I cut my teeth and learned. This is also how I made some close friends and ended up in some wickedly cracked private lobbies with some of the better known vets in the community, To watch them move through the maps was like watching lightning sear across the sky, The display of skill showed what the games movement mechanics could really do. During the DDOSing attacks, the games were limited as lobbies would be sent back to the menu and matches would crash. I stepped away at the peak of this and came back after a few months to find the game in a quasi playable state. people still played where they could and the community was just happy to play whatever matches they could get into. Games in vanilla TF|2 are still doable but it takes time and a lot of re-entering lobbies. People still play. There is still a community as of writing this.\n\nThen came the Northstar Client. This client made the multiplayer not only usable again, but also better than before. It is easy to download and install. I'm not super tech-savvy and I got it setup to launch the Northstar Client direct from Steam. All of the standard base game modes are there and you can even play the campaign through the Northstar Client. All skins, weapons, attachments, perks, abilities, and even titans are unlocked from the start. Even rare community event skins that you may not have unlocked in the vanilla game. All the original games modes for both Multiplayer and Frontier Defense are available to play as long as you can find a server, then there are the community modded game modes that really make the game fun. Like fast ball or gun game. Prime titans even have new loadouts and weapons like the brute cannon or the grapple hook. Northstar receives a fairly regular regiment of patches that fix bugs and security risks. over all a huge boost to get a game I love back up and playable again. You can try the vanilla Multiplayer, but I would highly recommend the Northstar Client to play the Multiplayer.\n\nSo overall I would personally give the game a 9 out of 10. It deserved better treatment than it got and more attention than it did. Hard to say what it would look like today if it had. But for what we have it is still an outstanding game. One that I hope to see continue getting new pilots to the frontier, eager to learn the movement mechanics and have a fun time zooming the maps. Stay safe out there pilots.",

I came back up again, learning from my mistakes.\nIn the journey, I faced many great enemies. Some I admired and respected while some I loathed and hated, yet thankful for them all.\nI made friends, learned from teachers, faced-off adversaries, fell in love, cried in loss, and shared on the happiness of each and every characters of the game. For those who may call me their consort, their lambkin, their tarnished, or even their lord; i express my thanks.\n\nThis game was my second entry to fromsoftwares, ( the first being sekiro), and I am at a loss of words to express the emotional rollercoaster I went through during my playthroughs. I now understand why their games are so well-celebrated and has such a vast community.\n\nIt doesn't matter if I am a lowly tanished, I shall never put my foolish ambitions to rest.",

But recently ive been wanting to have freinds again but all of my old friends dont want anything to do with me. Thats the reason why i bought this game. I actually consider all the NPC's like blaid and patches as friends. Ive built up a relationship with them that is stronger than my very own family. Everyday at work i get really excited thinking about this game and spending time with them. These npcs give me a reason to wake up everyday now and its made me realize that i dont need to be a lone wolf anymore.",

            "review": "Elden Ring was released almost 3 years after the first announcement but i can easily say that it was definitely worth the wait till the end. \n\nI think it is an excellent upgrade to Dark Souls 3. I loved mechanic of the ashes of war, big open world, and build variety quite. There are badass and cool bosses like Malenia, Maliketh, Mohg etc. but i have to say Dark Souls 3 has cooler bosses like Slave Knight Gael, Sister Friede and Nameless King. \n\nPvE: I have stopped counting after the 15th run. Lore in the game is beautifully and smartly designed.\n\nPvP: It is hell of a fun but please don’t use hp estus in the middle of the duel guys come on! In addition, maybe u can show some respect to people who duel by not interrupting their fight. These criticisms are for people who play that way, so i don’t blame people in general or the game itself.\n\nLong story short, Elden Ring will be on the top unless Bloodborne 2/Elden Ring 2/ Dark Souls 4 releases. [i] “This game is a blessing to the world.” [/i] This is the sentence i have been telling to my friends since it was first released and my opinion has never changed at all. My recommendation rate is 11/10.\n\nOne more thing to say :) i hope we can get a dlc soon.\n",

            "review": "We Were Here Forever is the refined crescendo the series has been building up to in past iterations.\nThe previous games established much of the basic premise and puzzle structures, but were clearly still unrefined and had a lot of things that detracted from the nicer aspects. But We Were Here Forever fixes all of those detractors and more.\n\nThis review will not contain spoilers, but if you want a TL'DR; the game is superb and an example of co-operative puzzle games and instantly one of my favorite puzzle games period.\nRegardless, time to get into the nitty gritty.\n\n---- Visual & Audio ----\n\nPut simply, I love the design of this world. The art style and level design are not only incredibly beautiful, but incredibly fitting thematically. The world feels simultaneously magical like straight out of a fairytale, but also still makes total sense to navigate and explore. The detail in designs is fantastic and the variety of areas and environments is diverse and at times breathtaking. Visually the game is a master class of using effective design decisions to showcase the story and the world as you navigate it.\n\nLevels are unique and feel refreshing to look at, while the puzzles are integrated organically into the surrounding world. With lighting and use of props the world highlights what it needs to to make navigating intuitive, and also does an effective job of conveying emotion and tension.\n\nThe sound design is clear and beautiful. The music of the game is gorgeous, and the voice acting of the characters has no right being as good as it is for a puzzle game. The Jester's voice actor in particular brought their absolute best, and I was continually impressed by their performance in various parts of the game.\nIf it were up to me, they'd get an award.\n\nThe use of cutscenes and animations, while subdued and not excessive, is very effective. And the visual and audio design of those cutscenes is fantastic and truly left an impression on me.\nAll of this combines into a style that I truly think will stand the test of time and will still inspire joy in people years from now. And all the kudos to the artists and sound designers, as well as the voice cast.\n\n---- Puzzles ----\n\nThe puzzles are plentiful, and yet incredibly unique. The puzzles didn't repeat themselves past their welcome, and were always intuitively designed to fit into the environment and to be easily approachable and understandable. As well as requiring you to move around whilst doing so, making it feel more kinetic and memorable than simply staring at a piece of paper or a machine. Offering a nice variety of both difficulty and type of puzzle means that you're not likely to get bored at lack of new things to try or puzzles to figure out. So if you want to be truly tested on various kinds of puzzles, this is the game for you without a doubt.\n\nThe communication between co-op partners is intuitive and encourages you to learn to communicate more effectively. The puzzles are designed in a way where you can describe the situation very well once you wrap your head around it, and all it often takes is for your partner to say one thing to set the light bulbs off in your head. In addition to this many levels involve changing around the perspective between you and your partner, as well as converging your paths only to separate them again.\nThis all makes for a far more organic feeling and free environment, making it feel less constrained and boxed in than previous We Were Here titles, or many other puzzle games.\n\nCommunication in-game is done through a simple but effective voice chat system incorporating a walkie talkie. (Though granted I played it with a friend over Discord, but it's nice to have for those that don't have that option or want the extra immersion.) Communication is key, and this is a good way to practice how well you and a friend can sync up and learn to convey information.\n\nThe puzzles never got on my nerves, though you might of course be different in this regard, but I was simply enjoying my time far too much. And overall the puzzles are fantastic and deal with so many unique concepts and gameplay methods that I can't help but applaud the developers.\n\n---- Gameplay ----\n\nPlaying the game is incredibly intuitive, navigating is easy and straightforward and the game does a fantastic job of introducing the environments and puzzles to you. The tutorial the game begins with is very effective at conveying all the basic skills you'll need to get started, and once the game proper begins it's a steady curve of improvement and challenge from one location to the next.\n\nThe gameplay is solid and functions as expected with the exception of a few slight bugs here and there, but nothing game breaking as far as I or my friend experienced. The controls are responsive and the way you interact with the environment or the puzzles are all simple to grasp on a technical level. The levels are designed in a way to make them quite easy to wrap your head around and figure out where everything is, with clever uses of memorable landmarks as well as good use of lines of sight.\n\nThis also extends to your partner, and locating each other is usually not too difficult. And if you have trouble figuring out where you are, just describe what you see and turn on your torch and finding each other is quick and easy. The co-op aspect of gameplay works without issues and I encountered no problems that prevented us from progressing during the entire duration of the game. Connection seems a non-issue (though that's to be expected) with the only slight desync happening for some animations.\n\nOverall the game is very accessible even if you're fairly new to first person games, and wrapping your head around the ordeal won't take too long to figure out.\n\n---- Technicals ----\n\nThe game runs flawlessly, with one notable exception. Transitions from level to level often cause lag and choppiness for some amount of time as the levels load in. However, it subsides quickly and once the game has finished loading everything in, all problems are gone. Performance is rock solid beyond these load moments, and I had no issues playing the game what-so-ever.\n\nThe controls are responsive and the menus are a vast improvement over previous titles in the series, and the UI is well designed and clean allowing you to take everything in properly.\nA lot of people kept referring to a bugged puzzle in the graveyard section of the game, but we encountered no bug in said area. Not sure if we simply got lucky, or if there's something else going on. But overall there was no real hindrance at any point to our playthrough or enjoyment, and overall the experience was pretty flawless.\n\n---- Closing thoughts ----\n\nUltimately it comes down to one simple fact. Do you like puzzles?\nIf you do, then this game is undoubtedly worth checking out, and a great way to spend some quality time with a friend. However it is worth noting that as a co-op only puzzle game.\nI would recommend either bringing along a friend, or finding suitable players on the community page or through other means. Since it definitely is a commitment, albeit a fairly small one.\n\nOverall We Were Here Forever is one of my favorite puzzle games of all time. Up there with games like Portal or Talos Principle. A unique and refreshing experience with beautiful designs throughout, a fantastic style, absolutely stellar voice acting and audio, and some of the most breathtaking and varied environments.\n\nThe developers have refined their talent, and have put out a game that truly is one of the best of its kind.\nAnd the amount of love and effort put into every corner of the game is undeniable.\n\nThe name of the game is incorrect, since we were only there for a couple evenings. But the game certainly makes a compelling case for why I would want to be there forever. Since it was truly a wonderful experience made with care and love.\n\nAnd I'd be lying if I said I didn't want much, much more of it.",

(20-40 fps, even with ideal settings.)  \n\nother then the bugs, i would rate We Were Here Forever a 9.5/10, and would recommend playing We Were Here Together first if you've never played any of the games in the series. We Were Here is a  fantastic series if you are into puzzle games or even just looking for something different to play with a friend.",

            "review": "Excellent game. finished it in about 12 hours. I'ts a co-op puzzle game which requires communications to figure puzzles out. They're very creative. Also, the exploration has been expanded ever so slightly from the previous games. I would love to see the exploration expanded on a bit. I really enjoyed taking in the scenery. Maybe adding some hidden collectibles in the next game? Only a few puzzles felt too easy, quick or otherwise not interesting. Everything else was a blast and they are all designed well. Also, I liked how some of the puzzles force you to learn the lore/plot, lol.\n\nIf you have someone to play this game with it's worth it. I recommend going back and playing the previous two games first, or at least the game before this one. Not required though.\n\nOnly negative - there is no accessibility mode. The puzzles fundamentally require you to be able to hear sounds and see colors accurately. If you're deaf or colorblind you may have an issue finishing this game, as your co-op partner cannot help you with these things, but actually relies on you to communicate these things to them.",

From the puzzles of varying difficulty and length, to the atmospheres that help immerse me into the game, each chapter that was played allowed me to enjoy the game more and more but also helped get the proverbial gears turning in my head for further puzzles. \n\nThe music alone is really nice and I would love to see a soundtrack available for download! :)\n\nAll together, We Were Here Forever stands to this date my favorite puzzle game and I am excited to go through it again! \n\n\nThe only issues I have had so far are sometimes the walkie-talkies would stop working for an entire chapter (restarting would fix) and in the last portion of the game, there is a animation to get up ladders which was kinda buggy but other than those two small bugs, smooth sailing.",

            "review": "It's a great coop only game. It's longer than any of the previous games in the series (took us 11hrs to do first run), and the quality is higher. Puzzles are varied and never too difficult. There does appear to be a way to find people to play with, but I would highly recommend grabbing a friend.\n\nI do have some criticisms:\n* The game forced us to accept an EULA. I don't know why that is necessary. Because it shouldn't be.\n* The game has an account system - god knows why, but at least it's optional.\n* Performance is certain parts, most notably the underwater part is quite bad\n* Some of the puzzles require one of the players to do majority of the thinking while the other player got not  much to do, which kinda is a problem\n* We had some connection issues mid game, where my friend simply could not connect to their proprietary servers. It would appear the game does not support Steam P2P and requires some bullshit online servers. What happens when the developer decides to shut them down?\n* The potion puzzle having a time limit is anti fun.\n* There are some inconsistencies in quality. Some loading screens are \"live\" where the game still has things happening, but most of the time it's a black screen. Another one that jumps out is the Rockbury cart ride, where certain things are clearly not animated when they should be. Certain interactions are not animated in 3rd person such as pushing revolving lever things. In most cases when you interact you cannot look around to see if your partner is fucking around or not.",

The dungeon system works on a thirst and hunger system, it's not bad, but it doesn't really stop you, just slows you down from getting to the end, I'm not seeing much of it's function when you don't have anything to work from it - literally, hunger down, no rations or food, teleport to town... stock up, go back.  just wastes 5 minutes of time. \n\nJust dull.",

The map loaded up. All of the units appeared. My FPS was hovering around 4. Totally unplayable. To its credit, it warned me it would be unplayable with that many units and even better is it DID actually load and run. So i quit and lowered the number of zombies to a more reasonable amount.\n\n5,000,000 Zombies vs. 50,000 WW2 Soldiers:\nWow. Not only did this run, but it ran fairly well. Absolutely playable, so here's how it went:\nI picked the map with the river with multiple bridges. Massive (that's 5 MILLION) zombie horde on one side, 50,000 WW2 soldiers on the other, placed 5,000 at a time at each bridge.\nThe game loaded relatively quick and I pressed the button to start the battle. The zombies started splitting off and heading towards the nearest foes, as did the soldiers. The problem here is that some of the zombies were far enough away that the soldiers crossed one of the bridges to attack, losing their strategic advantage.\n\nThe AI is fairly simple. Units will head for the shortest route to their enemies, and then stand in a massive blob waiting to attack. Nothing too exciting, but it works well enough for hordes of zombies.\n\nI let the game run on its own for a while, and when I came back I found that the zombies had (unsurprisingly) massacred the soldiers that had crossed the bridge and were now slowly streaming their way up to the other bridges, which were still holding just fine. It seemed that a relatively small force could hold off the zombies at a bridge, especially since they don't swim. This is when I decided to take action and use what I think is one of this game's strongest features. RTS Mode.\n\nI peeled off a small company of soldiers from a bridge that was being held just fine and started marching them down towards the zombies that had made it through. I split the force into 2 groups and slowly worked them up towards the bridge, one group moving while the other covered it. In a few minutes I had retaken the bridge. I made sure to issue an order for them to hold the position, and I left them to defend. Turning my attention to the rest of the battlefield, I found that some other soldiers were pushing too aggressively. They had pushed the zombies across the bridge and followed, but if they attracted too many zombies they would get overrun and another bridge would be open for the zombies to attack. I quickly grabbed some units from another nearby bridge and had them fire on the zombies while I pulled the squad back across the bridge to hold that position. Perfect. All bridges covered, no zombies advancing. At this point, I had lost nearly half of my units, while the zombies still numbered in the millions.\n\nAfter some waiting, I noticed that some areas were thinning out the zombies, so I decided to go on the offensive. I grouped up some units from these bridges while leaving some to defend just in case, and began advancing on the flanks of the zombies, which were now split into two giant groups on either side of the map. I slowly advanced the soldiers, and as they did more and more zombies would peel off from the groups at the bridges and come to attack my offensive line. Not enough though. I was able to slowly work through this group of over a million zombies and clear out this one side of the map. \n\nAt this point, the mountains of zombie corpses were so high by the bridges still defending that I was worried the zombies would be able to cross the river, which was now red. The entire landscape had been coated in blood. Low spots had practically formed new rivers that fed into each other. The landscape was being transformed with corpses and blood.\n\nOnce I cleared out the top half of the map, I issued an order for all the units up there to start marching on the lower half. It was only a matter of time before the zombies were wiped out, and they were. The last bridge to be cleared of zombies was the one that had originally been overtaken. It had held out this entire time with the handful of units I had left there. Finally, the last few zombies were picked off and I achieved victory.\n\nNow, I could have just left the game alone once I retook the bridge that had been overrun, and I probably would have won just the same. However, being able to take control of these massive numbers of units and take the fight to the overwhelming opposition and WIN? That's awesome. I played the original game a bit, but found it a bit dull after doing a few battles. Placing down a couple blobs of units and watching them run into each other for a while can only be fun for so long.\n\nIn this game I was worried that it would suffer from the same issue, just on a MUCH larger scale. RTS mode removes that worry. The game is still pretty slim on content, but what has been achieved with this new engine... It's hard to really even put into words how it feels to see that many units on screen and have the game perform anywhere near acceptably. More than that, to actually be able to issue commands to the units and have them (mostly) follow those orders? Wow.\n\nThe engine is an incredible achievement, and the actual gameplay makes me excited for where they could take this. RTS mode is the thing that brings what could be another dull unit blob-fest up to another level, and I hope that the developers continue to expand on it. Could we see this turn into a full-fledged RTS? I hope so. If not, there's still some great content here for battle simulations on a truly epic scale.",

So i ran my computer through what it could really do.  I didn't get into the exact number of units that I tried out but as the numbers got higher I made it a more general unit amount.  Anyway, to start, here is what I am running off of....\n\nMSI GF65\ni7-10750H CPU @ 2.60GHz\n32gb DDR4 2666\n1660ti w/ 6gb \n1tb kingston boot drive\n1tb samsung evo (\"steam drive\")\n(quick edits - by saying \"seamless below I mean no frame drops and also my graphics settings were set at mid-range with everything set to \"High\")\n\nI figured that units that used projectiles would probably be the ones that use the most and this turned out to be correct.  What I topped out at in this aspect was 1.5million vs 1.5million archers.  This game a seamless performance. I wasn't able to get the game itself to crash when I did higher amounts but to be honest I wasn't patient enough to let it run itself down to a more seamless unit total.\n\nAs far as non-projectile units I was able to keep a smooth 2.5million vs 2.5million foot soldiers.  Again, I tried the higher numbers without a crash and I did not wait for it to wear down to a more stable amount.\n\nLet me preface this by saying I never played UEBS 1 so if I mention something that was also in that game...oh well!\n\nThere are a few pretty cool things about this game other than its performance.  When large amounts of units are killed their blood will run in the natural channels of the landscape.  You don't actually see it flow so much as it is like watching a towel soak up something wet if that makes sense.  There a several units to choose from but even at that, you can use existing models and customize their stats and names and make them whatever you want.  Its pretty cool.\n\nThe ability to watch it play out, play a single soldier, or control several troops at once is pretty cool as well.  \n\nThe loading screens and the menus are a bit rudimentary but I see two reasons why this shouldn't matter.  First of all, it is early access and we can't expect a spit polish on this and second...lets be honest....who buys this game for the menus  Its not Ultimate Epic Menu Simulator now is it?\n\nTL:DR  The dev hardware/performance stats in the discussions seem to be pretty close if not slightly underrated (but in my opinion that is better than overrated!) and it is a great game to play!",

Most of characters in UEBS2 are modelled in house, where as UEBS1 characters are all from 3rd party sellers such as the Unity asset store.  Many new characters also have unique abilities as well, which requires custom coding."

I was just going to look past it, though, since it's a game. But, I am so unbelievably happy to say that they did it completely accurately. They say that a freeroam room is better for the rabbit, which it is. That made my entire day, and I am so, so happy they put the time in to do this accurately.\n\nAs for the DLC as a whole, it's so amazing already. You can have your dog follow you, or give it treats, pet it (of course), play tug of war, and so much more. I've always known the developers have a passion for their game, but this DLC just proves it even further. I 100% suggest this DLC, it's incredible.",

In fact, you aren't forced to have a pet at all, and you can just enjoy the new jobs, mechanics, and furniture on its own. That being said, the pet part is phenomenal. It adds a whole new element to the game, as the pets have different needs that need to be fulfilled like being hungry, dirty, or wanting to play. There's a ton of different types of pets too, from cats and dogs to parrots and spiders. Overall this DLC is turning out to be more than worth the wait, and makes for a great add-on to an already great game. 10/10, would recommend to anyone that's a fan of the base game, whether you care about having a pet or not.",

Over the course of next week, we will be releasing more of those in order to patch any issues that popped out after the release, as well as tweak the animal behavior.\nIf I may ask, please let us know about any issues you encountered through [url=https://frozendistrict.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HFS/pages/2847277075/House+Flipper+-+Support+Tickets]our support ticket platform[/url], so we can take care of them asap.\n\nHave a great day!\n- Reczberg"

            "review": "I'm going to start with a warning: this game has a lot of reading and you HAVE to read it or else nothing will make sense, so if you tend to skip dialogue or reading lore in games, this isn't for you. There is an option to change all the handwritten fonts to something more legible, but I'm not dyslexic, so I can't say if that font is dyslexic friendly. However, if you love reading, solving mysteries, identifying plants, and spooky, but not too spooky, aesthetics, buy this, you will adore it!\n\nVisually it reminds me of Sunless Sea, and the gameplay is somewhat reminiscent of mystery point and click games. The writing is brilliantly done, very atmospheric. I loved the story, it's very folkloric and references old witchcraft/pagan rituals. One complaint, if you can even call it that, I had to force myself to take breaks, otherwise I would have played it until I completed it in one sitting. But despite a short playtime, it's got multiple choices and therefore multiple endings, so there's more than one playthrough awaiting me. \n\nI enjoyed the gameplay. I'm not going to spoil anything, so my review of the gameplay is going to be a bit vague here. I love mystery games that don't make it super easy to solve stuff or give you the same \"one of us tells the truth\" riddle to solve, or the \"play the piano\" puzzle that seems to be in every mystery game. I'm not a huge fan of hidden object games because the puzzles feel so random, like you're tracking a serial killer, but suddenly there's a word search, and it ruins my immersion. This game DOESN'T do that, and I am so glad. Every puzzle/riddle feels story relevant and makes me feel fully immersed. This game made me feel smart, and at times, kind of dumb, which is why I play these games! I also played a bit with my partner helping and I think if you're looking for a mystery game to play with a partner, this would be a really good choice! We had fun.\n\nIt's a simple concept, but executed perfectly. I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves solving riddles, and lovers of the mystery genre in general.\n\nAlso any game that lets you pet your cat is amazing.",

The vibe of the game and the writing style reminds me of Fallen London, which I loved. The mystery that unfolds was intriguing too, and I liked that there were several different endings to explore. I think it speaks well of the game that I wished it was a bit longer, with more of the plant-finding, identification and elixir-making etc. For me, that shows how much fun those things were for me. Would love to see the game expanded in some way, but I am also genuinely very happy and impressed with it as it is.",

Not to mention every day will be the same in every playthrough except for a few clients so it basically has no replayability once you've finished it once.\n\nOverall it feels like the plants are simultaneously the core part of the game but also rather worthless since 80% of them have no use outside of being identified and given to the person asking for it (and some will never even get requested), so I don't know if this game will ever get more things added to it but I'd like for plants to have more uses (more potions perhaps) other than sitting in my shop with the game screwing up my organization every time I collect a new one.",

Strange Horticulture has a great sense of atmosphere, from its almost tactile-seeming gameplay and wonderful sound design (both the ambient sounds of the weather and the sound effects for picking up / putting away each item) to its gently spooky town inhabitants and mystery plot.\n\nThe developers clearly put a lot of thought and effort into this game, and I really appreciate how even small details serve to flesh out the world, characters, or atmosphere (like how there seems to be no real \"game over\", just a series of ominous puzzles to solve, or how you can tell that one of the characters has been consuming a lot of Drathium just by looking at their character portrait - even before you read their bio or talk to them). I also really enjoyed the drip-feeding of the story and puzzles for each day, which gives the game a really nice, consistent pace, as well as the brilliant use of the map - using it for puzzles while also giving a sense of where characters / events are located. All in all, this was a great game and is highly recommended!",

As a long time PlayStation user myself, I also enjoyed seeing the progression of Kratos from his earlier PS2/PS3 games and how all of his anger is now being handled as he ages. Literally my only qualm with this game is that the combat with minions before/in-between bosses is a bit repetitive and I would love to see a page out of the Souls/Elden Ring playbook of having mostly epic-scale boss fights with minimal fights in between. Even if it was the easiest difficulty to play the game or something I think that would have helped my 9/10 experience become a 10/10.\n\nRegardless, that is me being nitpicky and if you are even thinking about playing this game you absolutely should.",

Graphics, combat, voice acting, music, plot, all appeal to me and maintain the epic grandeur that characterize god of war stories. They also manage to understand what people want in a god of war game, and fill it with side quests and collectibles that are actually fun and cool to do...the side quests are what make this game special honestly, and the best moments are found while exploring the world. The one thing this game doesn't do as well as the others is boss fights. I felt that the boss fights were a bit lackluster, but admittedly I am comparing this to the other god of war games, which arguably have the best boss fights of any action adventure game. Compared to any other game, these boss fights are incredible, compared to the other god of war games, they are a bit unsatisfying. If you like action, adventure, combat orientated, open world games, this is obviously a game you must play regardless of reviews. One of the best games of its genre ever made.",

The game is not exactly open world - you have to complete a portion of each level in sequence to open up the next level. But it is usually less than half of each world, and the second half is much harder and sometimes inaccessible until later.\n\nThe puzzles range from \"not too difficult but still requires some thought\" to \"real head-scratcher\", and the difficulty ramps up nicely. There is no explanation or tutorial for the puzzle mechanics, you just have to try things out and pay attention to your surroundings to figure out how things work. It seems like most of the puzzles are designed so that you cannot just brute force your way though, you have to understand the mechanics for each puzzle. You will need pencil and paper for some puzzles, and screenshots are often helpful as well.\n\nI haven't beaten the game yet (I'm stuck looking for one solution [spoiler]that I suspect will open up some new puzzles[/spoiler]) but I've enjoyed my time so far.\n\nPros:\n[list]\n [*]Good puzzle design and variety of puzzle mechanics. Not a lot of repetition. Lots of \"aha moments\"\n [*]It feels like The Witness, but less pretentious\n [*]Runs smoothly, and I haven't noticed any issues.\n[/list]\n\nMixed:\n[list]\n [*]Not super long, I expect it might take 10-12 hours based on my current progress. But I'd rather have a shorter puzzle game with good puzzles than a long puzzle game full of easy or repetitive puzzles.\n [*][strike]One of the mechanics in the [spoiler]water area with the red green and purple blocks[/spoiler] was really complicated and I'm not sure if there was a better way to solve it other than [spoiler]essentially brute forcing it by keeping notes for each combination[/spoiler].[/strike] EDIT: apparently I am just impatient and [spoiler]this puzzle doesn't require any brute forcing[/spoiler]:D\n[/list]",

As the store page promises, it trims the crappy parts that the genre tends to build, namely the need to not grind which is pretty great. If you do push out to grind, it won't be for very long, enemies drop generous amounts of gold (almost overindulgent amounts near the tail end of the game).\n\n The story is paced fairly well, but I wish it had more complexity. The Humans you fight basically thrive on traditional Saturday morning bad guy shit with no possible redemption, while you happen to be the bad guys next door except your smarter than them, a victim to their bullshit, and also a pretty cute Drow Waifu.\nIt helps that the English localisation is clear and well done (I saw like 1 spelling error).\n\nThe big issue is that it ends VERY quickly (right as things get interesting). Its unfortunate since everything up to the very sudden end was pretty good. You can probably power through this game and still qualify for steams 2hr< refund window if you know where to go. For what it's worth, they did include NG+ options if you want more replay.\n\nThis game is thankfully reasonably priced, though you'll get better value when its on sale. I'm curious to see what the follow-up chapters are like.",

Just light meat, a singular thin slice of cheese, and bread.\nLooks great, but it's not quite what you expect. It's pretty much a visual novel with some simple fights between scenes, but you can pick which fights/scenes you want to play at any time. There's not a whole lot of fights either, and the enemy states what they're doing before they do it, you just have to plan out your moves based on that.\n\nOverall very short, maybe 30-60 minutes long if you don't make a ton of mistakes. For it's price I don't think the content adds up, so I can't recommend it on full price or light sale, but on a big sale sure. Not that it's bad, it's just way too short. I spent longer downloading it than actually playing it.\n\nOn the DLC/Patch side, not a whole lot there either.  Good quality, but only a few stills worth.",

NO FIGHT - NO NOTHING. THEY INSTANTLY WIN AND GET A TRUCE. THEY HAVE NO FLEET. \n\nIt was a death spiral of the worst kind. The situation system has these checkpoints in which slap on stronger and stronger debuffs. For the revolt - it's a STACKING stability loss. How are players supposed to dig their way out of this? Why can't the player fight back with - I don't know... their armies? In what universe does an Empire give up half its domain because some RECENTLY BULLDOZED primitives just kinda declared independence?\n\nIn my mind, I see it going something like this:\n\n“My Emperor! Dire news from the recently acquired colony!”\n\n“What is it?”\n\n“They’ve successfully passed 1000 signatures on change org petition and have declared themselves independent! What should we do, my Emperor?”\n\n“Firstly, immediately disband all the troops. Then give them half the territory of the empire. No… give them all of it. It’s only fair. After that, tell the fleet stationed there to run off in random directions and get hopelessly lost.”\n\n“Brilliant idea, my Emperor. Anything else?”\n\n“Give them a 10-year truce as well. I mean, what would others think of us if we didn’t give them time to build up...?”\n\nLiterally. What is this situation system? Are you kidding me paradox? This is the best you could do?\n\nEdit: Also, these \"revolt\" nations that get spat out get free 10k resources in minerals, energy, and even alloys. Good luck after 10 years in the early game! :)",

Because it is clear they have no idea how vassals work. Vassals don't get to CHOOSE to say yes or no. There is no negotiating with a vassal, that's the point. I've tried to use this system three times now for completely no result. Not a single empire that I subjugate is willing to switch to a specialist vassal. And it is a real slap in the face when you go through the entire process of battling it out with an equal opponent in the early game (the point where vassals would be the most useful), defeating them, and then watching as your demand that they become your research department is met with \"This agreement is of no value to us\" even after offering them literally every concession available. This is not diplomacy, this is not intended to be diplomacy, this is a military concept and it should be employed like one. Don't call it overlord and then force us to beg OUR vassals to do what we want. I give this a 5-10 until I get to see the new mega-structures.",

I invade a primitive civilization and no matter what I do, they still overthrow me and declare independence. I have tons of armies on the planet, my fleet in orbit and a starbase and I am building on the planet as fast as I possibly can to turn the situation around and no matter what I do, they always revolt. Oh and when they declare independence, they gain that system and any adjacent systems and you cannot attack them for 10 years.\n\nThe situation system is a losing game. Each tier of the revolt stacks a negative stability to your planet. How do you possibly fight this when you are given so little time? Honestly... The time it takes for your planet to fully revolt is just beyond a joke. Who play tested this update and said this was okay? If I could refund I honestly would. I just deleted my last save, closed the game and won't be playing again until the fix this mess. It's just absurd. There is absolutely no way to fight the revolt since the negative stability from each tier sets back ANY progress you make in fighting it, and each tier only takes like 500 or so in game days to complete, so you get time to build maybe a single building or district in the time it takes to go up a tier.\n\nThe actual overlord mechanics are also terrible. Want to propose terms to your vassals? They can say no... haha? How can someone you subjugated say no to you? Like bruh, I conquered you... You do as I tell you to, not the other way around. Terrible thought out systems that just do not seem like they were tested correctly.",

And in the peace you can receive the wrong systems. And you can get a situation requiring you to go positive in monthly production of a resource you cannot produce, nor buy on the open market  making you end up in a deathspiral. You'd think that it could be remedied via a monthly trade deal but no. The monthly trade system is completely broken, so anytime you make a trade deal, the AI accepts it, and then immediately cancels it.\n\nThere are also a number of balancing issues - like the fact that the balance between what you give a vassal and what you receive from a vassal is skewed by a factor of 10, making many DLC features completely unattainable.\n\nSo don't buy this DLC until it is 50% off and they fix the most glaring bugs.\n\n---------------------End of review - Beginning of rant:--------------------------------\n\nSadly, since we've seen from the example of the \"intelligence\" system, we can not expect the actual content and balance to ever be fixed - Envoys without levels or traits - and the most useless espionage system ever in a game - I'm looking at you.\n\nIt is such a shame that Paradox does this over and over - create the foundation for a great DLC - but never finishes it. Stellaris could have been Stellar! \nBut instead it flounders at treetop level and I find myself contemplating going back to master of Orion 2.\nWhat saves Stellaris is the fantastic mods. \nWithout the modding community I would have given up on this game years ago. \n\nIf Stellaris was a house you contracted Paradox to build, you'd be surprised when Paradox only delivered the buildings foundation - If you want running water, electricity, windows, doors, a roof that does not leak or any of the other things that makes a building habitable - You will find it at the workshop, not in any Paradox DLC.\n\nYes, I'm harsh, but this is years of frustration pouring out - Stellaris have added some great features in their DLC's too - But they're always, always lacking.\nAdd to that the clunky interface that has been in dire need of an overhaul for years now - the endgame lag - the bugs that never gets fixed, the cookie-cutter ship build etc. etc. and I'm beginning to feel like I've been tricked into paying to playtest a product that will never reach the market.",

The new vassal system completely strips any power from the Overlord as vassals can just, say no to everything?  And even if you invade, they can just say \"no\" and reconquer their system AND some of your territory without doing anything.  And this is if you can even get there!\nJust in the first game I played, I ran into:\nAn AI spawned directly on the border of a militant isolationist fallen empire, who then proceeded to declare war on them every 10 years like clockwork.  This is because the AI's home system was directly next to the FE's territory, and they couldn't dismantle the starbase since, y'know, their homeworld was there.  FE wars only end with humiliation and I think they're prevented from blowing up homeworlds, so they could never force the AI into a position where they wouldn't be angering the FE just by existing.\nI, a lithoid empire, received some refugees from a neighboring empire.  Because they eat food and I don't produce any food at all, I immediately got the \"you're out of food!\" event.  Because I didn't feel like wasting any district slots and jobs to produce food, I just set the refugees as undesirables and expelled them somewhere else.  As soon as they were gone, I stopped having a drain on food I didn't have, and the shortage event stopped progressing.  However... it only goes down if you start producing a surplus of food.  So I can't get rid of it, ever, without wasting resources and jobs producing food JUST to get rid of this event.  So I go to buy some food instead and... you can't buy resources you aren't producing or consuming.  And this leads me into...\nThe issue where it's impossible to create trade deals with other empires now.  I find an empire that's amicable and offer to trade 1 alloy per month for 1 food per month for 10 years, they agree and the deal goes through.  However, it immediately gets canceled because \"our trade deal has ended because the subjugation agreement was canceled,\" despite... there not BEING any subjugation agreement.  This happened no matter what I tried to trade, or who I tried to trade with.  So I'm just stuck with this food shortage event that isn't causing any actual problems, just taking up screen space.  Whatever.\nAnd then I boot the game up today and it's completely corrupted.  No galaxy map, no resources, no assets, no nothing.  I have literally never had a save corrupt in Stellaris before now.\n\nAbsolutely do not recommend, wait until they hotfix this into a playable state.  Absolutely inexcusable.",

            "review": "I have to agree with the majority of the negative comments. Vassals have way too much power over their overlords with this DLC. I have heard arguments that \"vassals are not slaves, so this system is realistic!\" but that's BS. Have you ever played any other paradox game or looked back at vassal relationships in actual history? Feudal lords always had the option to squeeze their vassals for more than they were willing to give. That comes with inherent risks obviously, but there is literally already a loyalty system included with this update. Why can't I set the terms of my vassals arrangement and the risk be that if I try to take too much from them that they will give me an ultimatum for better terms and if I refuse revolt or ally with another empire to take me down. In my experience it is literally impossible to set some terms. I want 15% research from a vassal so I am slapped with a -500 negotiation penalty for changing terms and a separate -450 penalty for the terms themselves meaning that even if I offered 75% of all of my other resources as subsidies it wouldn't matter and they wouldn't accept it. This makes it so that I do not even want to use the system I just got done spending $20 on. I certainly don't feel like an overlord when I am forced to keep my vassals happy and get next to nothing out of it. It essentially becomes a forced military alliance at best most of the time and nothing else. The core concept is great and I was excited for the update, but this was just a horrible execution. I think in the first video I saw about this update one of the paradox devs said about the DLC \"[They] didn't want vassalization to be an extended game over while you waited to be integrated\" so they did all of this. That should have been a red flag I suppose, but if you look at it from that angle it makes more sense. This update makes it more fun to be a vassal but certainly doesn't make me want to be an overlord.",

            "review": "EDIT: As of May 16, the stellaris devs announced a hotfix for some of the really pressing problems concerning vassal management I mention below. // \n\n[b]Hello fellow star travellers, interstellar dicators and galactic republics![/b] I have played Stellaris more than any other game in my steam library, and I've been very excited for this new dlc AND the free patch, which I will both cover in this review - my first one and also pretty long, personal and detailed. First, let me explain why I was so eager to play Stellaris again with Overlord and the new patch.\n\nI have never been fond of just conquering the whole galaxy while steamrolling every empire and just conquering all worlds for myself. I always felt that this lacked complexity and was a lot of struggling with revolting pops and warding off the penalties that you get for playing a really \"wide\" empire. So even before this dlc, I enjoyed playing the game more \"tall\" than wide, as a species that is powerful and excels at research and culture while having few very advanced systems and planets. One of the best playthroughs I ever had also involved me vassalizing half of the galaxy, leading a coalition of the (un)willing against my last enemy - that was before Overlord of course. So I thought: Overlord really improves my favourite style of play!\n\nWell, about that - its a bit complicated. So, what do I think about the new expansion?\n\n[b]First, the really cool stuff.[/b] In my view, playing \"tall\" received a buff. So far I have been able to use orbital rings to crank up my few specialized planets while adding even more useful stuff like spaceports and system defences. And the new Hyper Relays add a new dimension of strategic planning as it is extremely useful for rapid deployment along the major lines of operation - think of it as the intergalactic railway. Other megastructures I have yet to discover, but of course I'm excited for the catapult...\n\n[b]Now, the mixed bag of mercenaries.[/b] In my experience, they can really be a pain. Got one of the biggest fleets in the galaxy? Fine, your neighbour with \"pathetic\" military force can still attack you because he saved all his cash for a huge-ass merc fleet. Oh, and by the way: AI loves mercenary fleets and WILL push hard for resolutions that curb your own nav cap while making the use of mercs necessary for wars unless you don't care being in breach of galactic law. I'd like to see more diversification here: not all AI empires should enjoy PMCs and mercs like that, it should be contested a bit more. Pacifist empires enjoying merc fleets that are presented as \"peace-keeping professionals\" is a bit absurd. In my case, I was attacked by a weaker neighbour that actually was able to send superior fleets my way, so I was forced to hire mercs too to repel the attack and remind him of his place in the galaxy. All in all it was fun though as it makes playing against weaker empires more challenging.\n\n[b]My major complaint really is the new system of vassal management and contracts.[/b] To be fair, this has been introduced in the free patch, but the Overlord dlc really builds on this, so it has to be noted here. It has been criticized by other players, some of them really angry - and I think they have a point. In my case, one of the first wars I waged was against a direct neighbour and rival empire that could have become a problem in the long run. I destroyed his fleets and occupied all his planets, making him my subject. So one could expect that I will be able to force terms on him that he might not enjoy. But the mechanic really works a bit like federations worked before: The AI can simply refuse terms that are not benefical, even though the player just destroyed them in a war of subjugation, basically severely limitng YOU - the new all-powerful overlord. I was not able to assign the new vassal roles precisely because of this problem. This is really, really irritating as it can make vassals pretty useless. There is however a tendency I noticed: If you have a vassal for a longer period of time, you can gradually tighten their contracts. But this really takes far too long to be viable againt all those giant \"I will steamroll everything in my path\"-empires.\n\n[b]My call for the devs would be to fix this mechanic to account for the balance of power:[/b] Once someone is your vassal, your own military capabilities - that you could use to enforce your will by violent means - should be far more important for changing contracts. This way, the absurd imbalance between large interstellar overlords and small, broken and beaten empires could be taken into account. Or you could force your vassal to accept terms they don't like, damaging the relationship between overlord and vassal in a way that will make the vassal disloyal, plotting against you to overthrow your oppressive rule.\n\nTL;DR: So - the main selling point of this dlc seems a bit broken because the mechanic introduced in the free patch is broken. Why do I still recommend this game? Because I believe in Paradox' devs to fix this stuff and make the game better. I sincerely hope they will fix this soon because this would unlock the true potential of the expansion while balancing \"wide\" vs. \"tall\" play, making it a much-needed rework. In the meantime I will treat my vassals all nice and respectful of course [strike]because I don't have a choice[/strike] because I'm a nice guy.\n\nHope you enjoyed this personal account and review, have fun!",

The only minor problem i found is that it needs a little more polish on the menus and lacks of settings menu. Overall its a decent purchase, but i'd recommend only buying it when its on sale.",

The true horror comes from the feeling of being unable to escape by the use of limited character movement as is replicated by early horror games such as Silent Hill or RE series. \n\nI hope the dev continues to make and create games while improving his craft, he did a fine job for a first game.",
